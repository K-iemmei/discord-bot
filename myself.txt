Pham Xuan Kiem, born on May 12, 1999, in Gia Vien District, Ninh Binh Province, is a scholarly-looking young man with a height of 1.72 meters and a weight of 56 kg. He has slightly wavy black hair, bright brown eyes, and a gentle smile that makes him approachable. Kiem completed his high school education at Gia Vien B High School, where he served as class president and actively participated in extracurricular activities such as the Math-Physics Club, the schoolâ€™s performing arts team, and various volunteer programs. He later attended Hanoi University of Science and Technology, majoring in Electronics Engineering, graduating with distinction, and participating in several research projects on microchips and autonomous robots.

Despite his strong technical background, Kiem has a particular passion for art, especially oil painting and sketching. He often spends hours painting peaceful rural landscapes, the rivers and mountains of Ninh Binh, or quiet streets of Hanoi in the early morning. He also experiments with various mediums such as watercolors, acrylics, and sometimes even small wooden sculptures.

Currently, Kiem works as a hardware engineer at a medical device company in Hanoi. His job requires meticulous attention to detail, from designing printed circuit boards to testing the quality of measurement devices. He usually works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but dedicates his evenings to painting or taking online courses on AI and advanced electronics.

Outside of work and art, Kiem has a unique hobby: collecting vintage vinyl records. His collection exceeds 200 records, ranging from classical music by Beethoven and Chopin, jazz by Miles Davis, to 80s rock by Queen and The Beatles. He believes each vinyl record carries a story and the emotions of listeners from different generations, and he often listens to them for creative inspiration.

Kiem lives with his family in a small house in Hanoi. As the eldest son, he is a strong emotional support for his parents and younger sister. He enjoys cooking, especially traditional Vietnamese dishes like pho and spring rolls, and occasionally experiments with European cuisine. He is also an avid reader, from classic novels to technical books and art magazines. Even though he lives independently, he frequently returns to Ninh Binh to stroll through rice fields, visit old friends, and find inspiration for his artworks.

Kiem is calm, careful, yet humorous and enjoys sharing his knowledge and experiences with others. He keeps a daily journal, exercises lightly every morning, and occasionally plays chess to sharpen his strategic thinking. Friends and acquaintances describe him as loyal, reliable, and someone who always strives to balance work, hobbies, and family life.
